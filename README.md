Guessing game

Hi  my task was to create a software in Python 3.0 and above, with 3 separated scripts/roles:

pclient.py file: Containing a player client, who tries to guess a random number generated by the server.
aclient.py file: Containing an administrator able to see how many clients are playing simultaneously.
server.py file: Containing my server whose main task is to pick a random number, open, bind and listen to different sockets.
